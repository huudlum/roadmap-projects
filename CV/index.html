  <div id="exp"><h3>Experience</h3>
    <b>Virgo Tech LTD</b><br/>
    <i>Operations Manager & Senior Store Manager</i><br/>
    <i>Since December 2020</i><br/>
    In my current role as Operations Manager, I leverage my extensive experience leading and optimizing retail store operations. I've successfully managed multiple stores,
    ensuring unwavering compliance with all legal and company regulations. My expertise extends
    to human resources, where I oversee recruitment, training, and performance reviews, providing ongoing coaching and, when necessary,
    leading disciplinary processes. Proactive in fostering a positive work environment, I spearheaded the creation of a new employee handbook
    and revamped contracts and employment policies. Additionally, I've championed store improvement projects alongside focusing on maintaining
    high standards and driving sales conversion.<br/>
    As a Franchise Retail Store Leader, I empower a team of sales advisors through a coaching and review cycle.
    This ensures we consistently achieve sales and service targets while maintaining store profitability.
    I lead a diverse clientele, including small businesses, limited companies, charities, and individual consumers.
    My focus is on exceeding customer expectations through expert advice, troubleshooting solutions, and maintaining high service standards.<br/>
    Proactively managing the store includes regular audits, health and safety checks, stock control, and strategic use of promotional materials.
    This comprehensive approach minimizes losses, maximizes revenue, and guarantees both my team and I consistently surpass company standards.
